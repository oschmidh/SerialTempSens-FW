# Serial TempSens Board

`serial_temp_sens` implements up to three connectable NTC thermistors, as well as a small OLED module to display the temperature onboard.
The connection to the PC happens over USB (CDC-ACM).
Power is also supplied over USB.
More details as well as Schematic and Layout for the board can be found on [github](https://github.com/oschmidh/SerialTempSens-HW).
